# Hello World | ![Tests](https://github.com/theCompanyDream/hello-world/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

I made this projec because I don't really like the first program you write for coding. Printing a Hello World isn't coding and it never was. Coding is more than downloading an angualr client and running a few commands to start buliding a web site.

It's foremost a tool that we use to describe problems and then solve them. I hope to show this the goal isn't to make this overly complicated solution that "wows" people. It's just a simple program that anyone can create.

## Instalation

```bash
poetry install
poetry run
```
